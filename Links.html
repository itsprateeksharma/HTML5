    <p>A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
        Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on 
        any server anywhere in the world.</p>

      <p>A link has two ends, called anchors. The link starts at the source 
          anchor and points to the destination anchor, which may be any web 
          resource, for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, 
          an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="mysql">My SQL</h3>
<p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[5][6] 
    Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's
     daughter,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. 
     A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which
      data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure 
      the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract 
      data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. 
      In addition to relational databases and SQL

    <p>MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]

<h3 id="or">Oracle</h3>
<p>
    Oracle is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company was formerly headquartered in Redwood Shores, California, until December 2020 when it moved its headquarters to Texas.[7] The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software products—particularly its own brands of database management systems.
    </p> 
    <p>In 2020, Oracle was the second-largest software company in the world by revenue and market capitalization.[8] The company also develops and builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, Human Capital Management (HCM) software, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (AKA customer experience), Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) software, and Supply Chain Management (SCM) software.[9]

<h3 id="mssql">MS-SQL Server</h3>
<p>
    Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of

    <p>Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.

<h3 id="mdb">MongoDB</h3>
<p>
    MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with. Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data. MongoDB is a distributed database at its core
</p>
<p>  MongoDB, the most popular NoSQL database, is an open-source document-oriented database. The term ‘NoSQL’ means ‘non-relational’. It means that MongoDB isn’t based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This format of storage is called BSON ( similar to JSON format). A simple MongoDB documen</p>
